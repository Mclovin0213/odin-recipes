                <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
                <li>4 cups shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="lists">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a <br> 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. <br> 
                    When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute <br>
                    less than the package directs for al dente.  Drain and <br>
                    drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
                <br>
                <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss <br>
                    together to mix, then divide into three piles.  Approximately <br> 
                    3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, <br>
                    and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in <br>
                    flour and whisk to combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand. <br>
                    Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often.  Slowly pour <br>
                    in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking <br>
                    constantly, until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining milk/half and <br>
                    half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened <br>
                    to a very thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a <br>
                    semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, <br>
                    stirring to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups <br>
                    of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, <br>
                    stirring to combine fully.  Pour half of the pasta mixture into <br>
                    the prepared baking dish.  Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, <br>
                    then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake <br>
                    for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown.  </li>
            </ol>
